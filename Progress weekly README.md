# week2 (13.10.2022)
I discussed the progress of my project with Bea.this a project to develop empathy and how users develop skills for combating bullying. We discussed how to change the user and the setting, and to what extent the user should
 be able to choose their own character,  We discussed the need for the game to reflect a sort of ‘phycological physics engine’ as in to be effective the bullying simulated in the game should be based on research and the responses the user is being encouraged to learn is also based on research on how to respond to this sort of abuse Further development of the game, Screenshots or graphics from the game Further evidence of the research underpinning the project.

# week3 (20.10.2022)
Bea and I nailed down the game settings in my project. In order to avoid conflicts with the real cultural background, we decided to set the background of the game as a virtual world.

# week4 (27.10.2022)
I updated my project progress for Bea. I finalized the scene model and character model. Complete the basic code of some projects, such as completing the writing of the code for the character to control the forward and backward through W, A, S, D, click the space bar to jump
Completed the writing of the code for the increase/decrease of the character's energy value
The camera reads the Euler angle steering of the mouse's X-axis and Y-axis, which is bound to the character's head so that the character can move the perspective
Completed part of the enemy attack code, including playing the enemy model animation; the enemy finds and locks the player, generates bullets; the enemy attacks the player
Bea and I discussed my plans for the next week, and we planned to have 80% of the code done by next week.

# week6 (10.11.2022)
I basically finished my project. I sent a video of the project to Bea. He thought I should add some functions to the project. For example, the purpose of this game is to make people aware of the dangers of language violence. So, Bea thinks, Should add some kind of support at the end of the game, for children who are bullied, I
I think this is correct and necessary, so I added this feature to my game, if the player needs help, he can click the button in the game to directly connect to the assistance website for help, I also added some assistance calls to provide People who need help.We also discussed my thesis outline and Bea made some comments for my thesis
